# Drawers

A plugin that adds drawers to your Minecraft server for storing large
quantities of a single item.

## Usage

### Server Admin

1. Install plugin jar into your `plugins/` folder
2. Restart your server

The plugin can be configured in the `config.yml` that gets generated.

### User

To get started, craft a drawer by surrounding a chest with planks of any
kind in the crafting table:

Once you have the drawer, place it down (places like a barrel).

Holding the stack of items that you wish to place into the drawer, right
click the front.

You can now add more items by right clicking with them in your hand and
remove items by left clicking to take one, or shift lift click to take a
full stack.

## Building

To build the plugin, run

```sh
mvn package
```
